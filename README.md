# Project: Tool for Emulating the PAdES Qualified Electronic Signature

## Overview
This project aims to develop a software tool for emulating the qualified electronic signature, specifically for signing PDF documents according to the PAdES (PDF Advanced Electronic Signature) standard. The project will include both a primary application for signing documents and an auxiliary application for generating RSA key pairs, with the private key securely stored on a USB pendrive.
